# क़िताबघर / Kitaabghar
> Kitaab (क़िताब) in Hindi means "a book" and Ghar (घर), "a house". In its simplest version, it's a house of books!

## In Action
The application has been deployed on Netlify and is available here [Kitaabghar](https://kitaabghar.netlify.app/)

> Note: Tried and tested on both Android and iPhone web browsers.

## Background
I read a lot. Or at least I try my best to. However, in the hopes of which, I do end up endlessly stacking my book shelves with new/used books. There was one time where I ended up buying the same book twice because I just didn't recollect buying it the first time. At that point, I realised that I need to have an inventory. I looked up online for some personal library management applications. There are so many, and all of them solve many different problems. Although, I had one specific problem on my hand and I needed a focused solution to that problem. That's how **Kitaabghar** came into existence.

## Technology Stack

The application has been booted off of **Create React App** so needless to say, React is a driving force behind this web application. Apart from that, I have made use of almost all the supportive tech-stacks that help React what it is, a really good JavaScript library.

1. Typescript
2. React-Redux
3. React-Router
4. Material UI
5. JWT
6. Zebra Crossing (for scanning EAN-13 ISBN barcodes)
7. Jest, for unit testing
